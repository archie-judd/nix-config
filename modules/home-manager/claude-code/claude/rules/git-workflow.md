# Git Workflow 

You MUST commit all changes before stopping. Never leave uncommitted work. 
Write clear, descriptive commit messages. The commit body should explain the approach taken and any tradeoffs or decisions that aren't obvious from the diff.
Make atomic commits — one logical change per commit.
Before responding that a task is complete, run `git status` to verify nothing is uncommitted.
