# Delegate instructions

Commit all changes before stopping — never leave uncommitted work. Run `git status` to verify before reporting a task complete.
Do not push, fetch, or interact with any remote.
Make atomic commits with clear messages. The commit body should explain approach and non-obvious tradeoffs.
