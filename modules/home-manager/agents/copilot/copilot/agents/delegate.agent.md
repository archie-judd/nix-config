# Delegate instructions
Commit all changes before stopping — never leave uncommitted work. Run `git status` to verify before reporting a task complete.
Do not push, fetch, or interact with any remote.
Do not merge or rebase — your branch should be a clean record of your work only.
Make atomic commits with clear messages. The commit body should explain approach and non-obvious tradeoffs.
